# This seeds file should ensure the existence of database records required to run the app.
#
# The code should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any time.
#
# To load the seeds, run `hanami db seed`. Seeds are also loaded as part of `hanami db prepare`.

# Example:
#
#   categories = Hanami.app["relations.categories"]
#   categories.insert(title: "General")
